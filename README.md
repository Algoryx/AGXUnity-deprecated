# AgXUnity
*Unity3D bindings for [AgX Dynamics](http://www.algoryx.se/products/agx-dynamics/)* from [Algoryx Simulation](http://www.algoryx.se).

AgX Dynamics is a professional *physics engine* which deliver stable, robust and realistic dynamic simulations. AgX is being utilized in hundreds of training simulators and help engineers design and evaluate new mechanical systems in [Dynamics for SpaceClaim](http://www.algoryx.se/products/dynamics-for-spaceclaim/).

With AgXUnity, it is possible to incorporate a *real* physics engine into a well known authoring environment for 3D real time content, Unity3D. 

AgXUnity is still rather in a premature state. It give you a starting point for extending the scripting and gui capabilities to cover larger portion of the vast AgX Dynamics API. We really appreciate if you do git pull request to make this a better binding for everyone using it. 

 
- AgXUnity allows you to utilize AgX Dynamics inside Unity3D.
- Currently it is built and tested with Visual Studio 2015 SP1.
- The plugin is tested with Unity 5.3.4
- agxUnity is free, for more details see: [LICENSE](LICENSE)

**Note:** that AgXUnity is an interface/binding to AgX Dynamics, and access the dynamic simulation, requires a binary installation of AgX Dynamics including a valid  license.

See [Doc/DeveloperGuide.md](Doc/DeveloperGuide.md) for detailed information on how to install/develop and deploy AgX Unity.

[Creating your first scene tutorial](Doc/tutorial1/tutorial1.md) show you how to create a scene populated with simulated AgX objects.

We *really* appreciate feedback. If you have suggestions for improvements, just make a pull request. Together we can make this a great bridge between the awsome graphics of Unity3D and the world class dynamic simulation of AgX Dynamics.
